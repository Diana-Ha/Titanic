# titanic
This project focuses on analyzing Titanic survivor data from Kaggle using Pandas and visualizations(Matplotlib and Seaborn).

A couple of things before we get started:
- To view the data dictionary detailing the descriptions of each column, go here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
- The data required to run my notebook has already been downloaded and is titled "train.csv".
- All cells have been annotated, describing what I am trying to do or display and (if applicable) commenting on the output of that cell
- In terms of work flow, I start by reviewing the data (specifically focusing on nulls or missing data), cleaning the data, performing some feature extractions, and then exploring the data to answer the following questions:

1. What was the survival rate overall?
2. Which gender fared the worst? What was their survival rate?
3. What was the survival rate for each `Pclass`?
4. Did any reverends survive? How many?
5. What is the survival rate for cabins marked **¯\\_(ツ)_/¯**
6. What is the survival rate for people whose `Age` is empty?
7. What is the survival rate for each port of embarkation?
8. What is the survival rate for children (under 12) in each `Pclass`?
9. Did the captain of the ship survive? Is he on the list?
10. Of all the people that died, who had the most expensive ticket? How much did it cost?
11. Does having family on the boat help or hurt your chances of survival?

- In the end, I created several charts showing the survival rates of different groups of people.

# Results and Findings
If you have gone through my notebook, you will notice that if you were a man on the Titanic, your chances of survival were slim, regardless of your boarding class, age, port of embarkation, etc.
